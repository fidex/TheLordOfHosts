The naming of these cartridges should follow the rule: ', ', e.g.:', 'Cartridges in customer projects should follow the same principles as Intershop cartridges. However, to make a distinction easier it is recommended to prepend an identifier for the vendor into the cartridge name, like (Customer "XYZ"):', 'Any cartridge may define an API (for example, using the common CAPI package convention) and / or provide an implementation (that must be located in internal packages, like usual). There may be cartridges that only consist of API and other cartridges that only consist of implementation code, and some cartridges may contain both. There is no special naming for pure API cartridges, as every cartridge is considered to be "equal". If the purpose of an implementation cartridge is to provide the implementation for a certain technology, this should be reflected in the cartridge name.', 'Example:', 'When developing a new application, a developer could start on the application layer. It is perfectly okay to put ALL the implementation code into this application cartridge, including application definitions, templates, pipelines, business objects, persistent objects and so on. When developing another application, this application could also be completely "self-contained". However, this approach is not very useful, since everything had to be implemented again and again. Instead, we want to benefit from a maximum reuse of code and existing concepts. Therefore, the common approach is to create "abstractions" or "generalizations" of concepts and move them to the lower architectural layers. This also means that such abstractions must be designed for reuse in multiple different contexts.', 'Examples:', 'No keywords for this document.', 'The information provided in the Knowledge Base may not be applicable to all systems and situations.
